# Boston-Housing-Data-Analysis-Project

This repository contains statistical methods and visualizations to analyze housing data from the U.S. Census Service. Our goal is to derive meaningful insights and answer specific questions about the dataset.

## **Project Scenario:**

We have been provided with a dataset on housing prices derived from the U.S. Census Service. Our objective is to perform a thorough analysis to uncover insights and answer the following key questions:

1. **Charles River Influence:**

  * Is there a significant difference in the median value of houses bounded by the Charles River compared to those that are not?

2. **Impact of Age of Buildings:**

  * Is there a difference in the median values of houses based on the proportion of owner-occupied units built before 1940?
  * We will categorize the age of buildings into three groups: 35 years and younger, between 35 and 70 years, and 70 years and older.

3. **Nitric Oxide and Business Acres Relationship:**

  * Can we conclude that there is no relationship between nitric oxide concentrations and the proportion of non-retail business acres per town?

4. **Distance to Employment Centers:**

  * What is the impact of an additional weighted distance to the five Boston employment centers on the median value of owner-occupied homes?

To answer these questions, we will use appropriate statistical tests and visualizations. The steps include generating basic statistics, performing hypothesis tests, and creating various charts and graphs to present our findings.

## **Analysis Plan:**

1. **Data Preparation and Cleaning:**

  * Load the dataset and perform necessary data cleaning and preprocessing steps.
  * Handle missing values and outliers if any.

2. **Descriptive Statistics:**

  * Generate summary statistics for all variables to understand their distributions and key characteristics.

3. **Visualizations:**

  * Use histograms, boxplots, scatter plots, and bar charts to visualize the data and identify patterns and relationships.

4. **Hypothesis Testing:**

  * **Question 1:** Use a t-test for independent samples to compare the median values of houses bounded by the Charles River.
  * **Question 2:** Perform ANOVA to analyze differences in median house values based on the age of buildings.
  * **Question 3:** Calculate the Pearson correlation coefficient to examine the relationship between nitric oxide concentrations and the proportion of non-retail business acres.
  * **Question 4:** Conduct linear regression analysis to determine the impact of the weighted distance to employment centers on median home values.

5. **Interpretation and Insights:**

  * Interpret the results of the statistical tests and visualizations.
  * Draw conclusions based on the findings and provide recommendations or insights where applicable.

## **Outcome:**

By the end of this project, we aim to present a comprehensive analysis report that includes statistical findings, visualizations, and interpretations to answer the specified questions about the Boston housing dataset.
